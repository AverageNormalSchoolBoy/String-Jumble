The purpose of this challenge is to gain proficiency with 
manipulating lists.

Write and submit a Python program that accepts a string from 
the user and prints it back in three different ways:

* With all letters in reverse.
* With words in reverse order, but letters within each word in 
  the correct order.
* With all words in correct order, but letters reversed within 
  the words.

Output of your program should look like this:

Please enter a string of text (the bigger the better): There are a few techniques or tricks that you may find handy
You entered "There are a few techniques or tricks that you may find handy". Now jumble it:
ydnah dnif yam uoy taht skcirt ro seuqinhcet wef a era erehT

erehT era a wef seuqinhcet ro skcirt taht uoy yam dnif ydnah
"""

sent= input("Please enter a string of text (the bigger the better): ")

st = (list(sent))
st.reverse()
''.join(map(str, st))
rd = st.split()
rd.reverse()
print(''.join(map(str, rd)))

print (st)
nd = sent.split()
nd.reverse()
print(' '.join(map(str, nd)))
